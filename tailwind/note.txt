FLEX: 

Thre divs if you have, it will be in three row 
--
--
--

If you want them in one line you just have to add flex 

-- -- --
display:flex and justify-content:center 


In Tailwind : 

className = "flex justify-center"


GRID 

Another way to achive -- -- -- this is using GRID 

className = "gril grid-cols-3" // this will give equal width to three columns

un even width distributions looks something like this : 

<div className="grid grid-cols-12">
    <div className="col-span-5"></div>   // This guy will take 5 column space 
    <div className="col-span-5"></div>   // This guy will take 5 column space 
    <div className="col-span-2"></div>   // This guy will take 2 column space 
</div>


RESPONSIVENESS

For example when width is smaller you need grid-cols-3 when it becomes smaller you need grid-cols-2 more smaller you need grid-cols-1


Five Breakpoint Prefix :

2xl 1536px   

It is mobile first 

WRONG : 
<div class="sm:text-center"> this is text which should be centered in mobile screen </div>

RIGHT : 
<div class="text-center sm:text-left"> this is text which should be centered in mobile screen </div>
By default text-center, when screen bigger than sm than text-left
